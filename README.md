# Memory Allocation and Management in Different Languages


1. Python 🐍

Automatic Memory Management :-

Uses a private heap space managed by the Python Memory Manager.

Developers don’t manually allocate or free memory.


Garbage Collection :- 

Python uses reference counting + generational garbage collector.

Objects with zero references are collected automatically.


Memory Optimizations :-

Small integers & strings are interned for efficiency.

sys.getsizeof() can check object size.



✅ Key takeaway: Python handles memory automatically, but large data structures should be carefully managed. 



2. C++ ⚡

Manual Memory Management :- 

new → allocate memory on heap.

delete → free memory.

Example:

int* ptr = new int(5);
delete ptr;


Stack vs Heap :-

Stack → automatically managed (local variables).

Heap → programmer must allocate/free explicitly.


Issues :-

Dangling pointers, memory leaks, double free.


Smart Pointers :- 

unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr manage memory safely.



✅ Key takeaway: Powerful but risky. Proper delete or smart pointers are essential. 



3. Java ☕

Automatic Memory Allocation :-

Objects always created on the heap using new.


Garbage Collection (GC) :-

JVM handles memory cleanup.

Uses generational GC: Young, Old, Permanent generations.


Finalization :-

finalize() method (deprecated in modern Java).


Memory Structure :-

Heap → Objects.

Stack → Method calls, local variables.

Metaspace → Class metadata (replaced PermGen).




# Core Computer Science Pointers (6/09/25) 

1. Optimization Models & System Design 🛠️

Optimization in CS :- 

Goal: Minimize cost / maximize performance under constraints.

Linear Programming (LP), Integer Programming, Dynamic Programming.


System Design Principles :- 

Scalability: Handle growth (horizontal vs vertical scaling).

Reliability: Fault tolerance, replication.

Efficiency: Low latency, caching, load balancing.

Modularity: Divide into components/microservices.


Applications :- 

Search engines, Recommendation systems, Distributed systems.




2. Computational Complexity ⏳

Goal: Classify problems based on resource usage (time & space).

Asymptotic Notations :- 

Big-O (O) → Upper bound (worst case).

Omega (Ω) → Lower bound (best case).

Theta (Θ) → Tight bound (average/typical case).


Complexity Classes :- 

P → Problems solvable in polynomial time.

NP → Problems verifiable in polynomial time.

NP-Complete → Hardest problems in NP (if one is solved in P, all are).

NP-Hard → At least as hard as NP problems.


✅ Key takeaway: Complexity helps us know whether a problem is feasible to solve at scale.




3. Performance Comparison Between Languages ⚖️

Factors :- 

Execution Speed: C/C++ > Java > Python.

Memory Management: C++ (manual), Java (GC), Python (auto + GC).

Ease of Development: Python > Java > C++.

Portability: Java (JVM), Python (interpreter), C++ (compiled binaries).



4.  Python with Other Platforms, Languages & Domains 🐍

With C/C++ → Use Cython, ctypes, cffi for speed-critical tasks.

With Java → Jython bridges Python and JVM ecosystem.

With Web → Django, Flask + JS frameworks for full-stack apps.

With Data/AI → NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch dominate ML.

With Cloud/DevOps → Automation (Ansible, Fabric, AWS SDKs).
