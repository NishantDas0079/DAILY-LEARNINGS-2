# Memory Allocation and Management in Different Languages


1. Python üêç

Automatic Memory Management :-

Uses a private heap space managed by the Python Memory Manager.

Developers don‚Äôt manually allocate or free memory.


Garbage Collection :- 

Python uses reference counting + generational garbage collector.

Objects with zero references are collected automatically.


Memory Optimizations :-

Small integers & strings are interned for efficiency.

sys.getsizeof() can check object size.



‚úÖ Key takeaway: Python handles memory automatically, but large data structures should be carefully managed. 



2. C++ ‚ö°

Manual Memory Management :- 

new ‚Üí allocate memory on heap.

delete ‚Üí free memory.

Example:

int* ptr = new int(5);
delete ptr;


Stack vs Heap :-

Stack ‚Üí automatically managed (local variables).

Heap ‚Üí programmer must allocate/free explicitly.


Issues :-

Dangling pointers, memory leaks, double free.


Smart Pointers :- 

unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr manage memory safely.



‚úÖ Key takeaway: Powerful but risky. Proper delete or smart pointers are essential. 



3. Java ‚òï

Automatic Memory Allocation :-

Objects always created on the heap using new.


Garbage Collection (GC) :-

JVM handles memory cleanup.

Uses generational GC: Young, Old, Permanent generations.


Finalization :-

finalize() method (deprecated in modern Java).


Memory Structure :-

Heap ‚Üí Objects.

Stack ‚Üí Method calls, local variables.

Metaspace ‚Üí Class metadata (replaced PermGen).
